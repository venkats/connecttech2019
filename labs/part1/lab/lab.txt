In this lab we will build the frontend for a books inventory application.
The application will get data from the backend, a list of books (name, author, 
year, and quantity) and display them in a sorted list.

A series of ignored tests have been provided. Take one test at a time, change 
xit to it to enable the test. Then implement minimum code to make that test to 
pass. Once a test passes, leave it enabled and move on to the next test.

Let's work on these files, in the following order:
book.spec.ts
books.service.spec.ts
books.component.spec.ts
books-sort.pipe.spec.ts
app.component.spec.ts

To run the tests and then the program, please use the following commands:

1. npm install

2. npm test
Leave the above running until all tests have been enabled (one at a time of course) and all tests are passing.

3. ng build
4. npm start
5. npm run e2e
6. npm test -- --code-coverage
7. View the application by visiting http://localhost:3000

The application should list book details
